# happy-number [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ghpabs/happy-number.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ghpabs/happy-number)

A *happy number* is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1 are happy numbers**, while those that **do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers** (or sad numbers).
